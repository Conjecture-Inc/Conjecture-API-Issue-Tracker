# Conjecture API Issue Tracker

This repository serves as a centralized platform to report and track issues, bugs, and feature requests related to the Conjecture API. Your feedback is invaluable in helping us improve the API and maintain a high-quality user experience.

## How to Report an Issue

1. **Search for existing issues.** Before creating a new issue, please check if someone else has already reported the same issue. This helps avoid duplicates and makes it easier for us to address the problems.

2. **Create a new issue.** If your issue is not reported yet, click on the "Issues" tab and create a new issue. Please provide as much information as possible to help us understand and reproduce the issue.

   - For bugs, include a clear description of the problem, steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior. If possible, share screenshots or logs to help us better diagnose the issue.

   - For feature requests, describe the feature and explain why it would be beneficial. Provide as much context as possible to help us understand the value of the feature.

3. **Label your issue.** Use appropriate labels to categorize your issue (e.g., `bug`, `feature request`, `documentation`, etc.). This helps us prioritize and sort the issues more effectively.

4. **Stay engaged.** Once you've reported an issue, please be responsive to any questions or feedback from the maintainers. This will help us address your issue more effectively.
